## 💡 Practice Tips

### Study Strategy
1. **Topic Mastery**: Complete all easy problems in a topic before moving to medium
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Group similar problems and solve them together
3. **Time Boxing**: Set 25-30 minutes for medium, 40-45 for hard problems
4. **Mock Interviews**: Do at least 2-3 mock interviews weekly

### Interview Preparation Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Arrays, Strings, Two Pointers
- **Week 3-4**: Trees, Graphs, DFS/BFS
- **Week 5-6**: Dynamic Programming patterns
- **Week 7-8**: Binary Search, Heap, Stack
- **Week 9-10**: Advanced topics (Trie, Union Find, Backtracking)
- **Week 11-12**: Mock interviews and weak areas

### Common FAANG Patterns
1. **Sliding Window**: Substring problems, Maximum/minimum in subarray
2. **Two Pointers**: Sorted arrays, Palindromes, Container problems
3. **Fast & Slow Pointers**: Cycle detection, Middle element
4. **Merge Intervals**: Overlapping intervals, Meeting rooms
5. **Cyclic Sort**: Missing numbers, Duplicates
6. **Tree BFS**: Level order, Zigzag traversal
7. **Tree DFS**: Path sum, Diameter, Serialize/Deserialize
8. **Dynamic Programming**: Optimization, Decision making
9. **Backtracking**: Permutations, Combinations, Subsets
10. **Graph Traversal**: Islands, Shortest path, Connected components
