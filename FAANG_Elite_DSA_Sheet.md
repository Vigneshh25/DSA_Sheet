## 📝 Notes
1. Problems are tagged with companies that frequently ask them
2. Focus on understanding patterns rather than memorizing solutions
3. Practice mock interviews after completing each section
4. Time yourself - aim for optimal solutions within 45 minutes
5. Review and understand all test cases before coding

## 🎯 Interview Tips
- Start with clarifying questions
- Think out loud while solving
- Consider edge cases early
- Optimize after getting a working solution
- Practice explaining complexity analysis

## 📈 Recommended Study Order
1. Arrays & Strings → Two Pointers → Sliding Window
2. Trees → Graphs → DFS/BFS patterns
3. Dynamic Programming (after mastering recursion)
4. Binary Search → Sorting algorithms
5. Stack & Queue → LinkedList
6. Advanced topics (Trie, Union Find, etc.)
