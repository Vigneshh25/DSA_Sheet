## 💡 Tips for Success

### Daily Routine
1. **Warm-up** (15 min): 1 Easy problem
2. **Main Practice** (1-2 hours): 2 Medium problems
3. **Challenge** (45 min): 1 Hard problem
4. **Review** (15 min): Revisit yesterday's solutions

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Understand**: Read problem 2-3 times, clarify constraints
2. **Plan**: Draw examples, identify patterns
3. **Code**: Start with brute force, then optimize
4. **Test**: Check edge cases
5. **Analyze**: Time/Space complexity

### Interview Preparation
- Practice explaining your thought process out loud
- Write clean, readable code with proper variable names
- Always consider edge cases
- Start with a working solution, then optimize
